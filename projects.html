        <h3>finance anomaly detector</h3>
        <p>an end-to-end fraud detection system built with machine learning. features a react frontend for real-time transaction analysis, fastapi backend for high-performance api serving, and xgboost model achieving 92.2% roc-auc accuracy. includes docker deployment, comprehensive testing, and production-ready architecture. processes transactions in under 200ms with confidence scoring and risk level classification.</p>
        
        <h3>ant colony simulation</h3>
        <p>multi-agent simulation demonstrating emergent intelligence and collective problem-solving. built with javascript and d3.js for real-time visualization. simulates 1,000+ concurrent agents following simple rules that lead to complex behaviors. explores concepts like swarm intelligence, pathfinding algorithms, and emergent patterns in distributed systems.</p>
        
        <h3>movielens analysis</h3>
        <p>comprehensive data analysis and machine learning project on the movielens dataset. includes exploratory data analysis, recommendation system implementation, and predictive modeling. uses collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and deep learning approaches. features data visualization, user behavior analysis, and model performance comparison across different algorithms.</p>
        
        <h3>malaria reprioritization tool</h3>
        <p>ai-powered geospatial analysis tool for optimizing health intervention strategies. built conversational ai interface using openai gpt-4 for natural language queries. reduced analysis time by 87% from 3 hours to 15 minutes. supports 600+ concurrent users with sub-2 second response times. deployed on aws with 99.9% uptime serving health workers across 15 regions.</p>
